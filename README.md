Passive-ish Changes:
-
- Corrupted Entry Transition Duration 1s => **0.6s**.
- - Don't get me wrong, the transition looks cool but it's a bit annoying having to wait so long.

Passive Changes:
-
- Corruption Per Second In Combat 3 => **5**.
- Corruption Per Second Out Of Combat 3 => **3.5**.
- - Done to spice up the gameplay loop a little bit, I find it more interesting to accept the inevitable, instead of delaying it indefinitely.
- Corruption Per Crit 2 => **0**.
- - Doesn't make that much sense, so I took it out as I dislike crit synergies.
- Corruption Armor Gain 100 => **-40**.
- - This is a big one. In my mind, the Corrupted form is much stronger, but also much riskier, while Hopoo thought slapping on 100 armor was a good idea.
- - Change was also made to disincentivize holding M1, make it less viable and or potent, and to make thinking and repositioning more important.
- Corruption For Full Heal -100 => **-115**.
- Corruption For Full Damage 50 => **40**.
- - Some small tweaks to make the mechanic shine through more.
- Healing Multiplier 100% => **60%**.
- - Another decently large change, I wanted to make taking healing actually matter for a downside.

M1 Changes:
-
- Drown Radius 2m => **1m**.
- - This also reduces the autoaim radius.
- Drown now additionally fires a medium beam every fourth shot for **175%** damage in a **5m** radius with **no damage falloff** and a proc coefficient of **0**.
- - Something to spice up the boring M1. Should be fun enough in the short gameplay loop of Uncorrupted.
- Corrupted Drown Damage 2000% => **1200%**.
- Corrupted Drown Proc Coefficient Per Second 5 => **4**.
- - Big nerfs to Corrupted Drown, to make holding it not as OP, but still really strong.
- Alternate M1: Permeate
- - Two-hit melee combo for 220% damage, every other slash lunges. Corrupt form attacks rapidly and stacks a debuff that reduces attack and movement speed on the target.

M2 Changes:
-
- Flood can now be used during any skill.
- - I swear I didn't copy this Bog lol
- Corrupted Flood Force 3000 => **-2500**.
- Corrupted Flood Radius 10m => **25m**.
- Corrupted Flood Damage 1100% => **400%**.
- Corrupted Flood Projectile Speed 70m/s => **40m/s**.
- Corrupted Flood Lifetime 99s => **4s**.
- Corrupted Flood Cooldown 4s => **7.5s**.
- Corrupted Flood now pulls in enemies in a **25m** radius.
- - BIG changes to make it stand out, be more fun and stronger in a different way.

Special Changes:
-
- Suppress Healing 25% => **17.5%**.
- Suppress Max Charges Infinite => **2**.
- Suppress Corruption Loss 25 => **15**.
- - Putting a limit to Suppress is a big change, to make Corruption actually inevitable.
- Corrupted Suppress Self Damage 25% => **19**.
- Corrupted Suppress Duration 1s => **0.8s**.
- Corrupted Suppress Endlag 1s => **0.3s**.
- - Should feel a bit smoother, and decently easy to use as long as you're playing well.
- - These changes put together make for a fun short gameplay loop between the Uncorrupted and Corrupted form.
